## Overview
RyanBot is a discordbot that replies with "I'm Ryan!" whenever a discord user says "I'm" in their message. More specifically, RyanBot sends it in this format: "Hi {whatever the user wrote after the first instance of "I'm"} I'm Ryan!"

### Features
RyanBot can be muted or unmuted, can reply sometimes or all the time, and its status can be checked at any time. Additionally, the chance that it does reply if "sometimes" option is enabled can be modified too. RyanBot can store multiple server options as well as server statistics such as the number of jokes sent in total.

### Future Features
At the moment, there is nothing important to be implemented for RyanBot. However, in the future, RyanBot can add a feature to tell dadjokes. Additionally, features are being considered to make Ryan bot reply to custom "triggers" like user-set phrases or emotes.
